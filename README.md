# Exploratory Data Analysis on Churn Rate

This project focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to churn rate. Churn rate refers to the percentage of customers who discontinue their subscription or stop using a service during a given time period. The aim of this analysis is to gain insights and understanding about the factors that contribute to churn, in order to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to reduce it.

## Introduction

In this project, we explore a dataset containing various features related to customer behavior, demographics, and usage patterns. By analyzing these variables, we aim to identify patterns and relationships that may be associated with churn rate. This analysis will provide valuable insights to help us understand the factors influencing churn and guide our decision-making process.

## Variable Identification and Typecasting

The first step in our analysis is to identify the variables present in the dataset and understand their types. By performing variable identification and typecasting, we ensure that the data is properly categorized and can be analyzed effectively. This process involves examining the data structure and assigning appropriate data types to each variable.

## Univariate Analysis

Univariate analysis involves examining individual variables in the dataset. Through this analysis, we gain a deeper understanding of each variable's distribution, central tendency, and dispersion. By visualizing and summarizing the data using statistical measures, we can uncover important insights about the dataset's characteristics.

## Bivariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis focuses on exploring the relationship between two variables. By analyzing the interactions between different variables in our dataset, we can uncover correlations, dependencies, and potential causal relationships. This analysis will help us identify which variables are most influential in predicting churn rate and understand how they interact with each other.

## Imputing Missing Values

Missing values in a dataset can hinder the accuracy of our analysis. Therefore, we employ techniques to impute or fill in missing values using appropriate methods. By imputing missing values, we ensure that our analysis is based on a complete dataset, allowing us to draw more accurate conclusions.

## Imputing Outliers

Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset. These extreme values can distort our analysis and lead to misleading interpretations. To address this, we employ techniques to identify and impute outliers. By handling outliers effectively, we enhance the reliability and accuracy of our analysis.

## Conclusion

By conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis on the churn rate dataset, we have gained valuable insights into the factors influencing customer churn. Through variable identification, typecasting, univariate and bivariate analysis, as well as imputing missing values and outliers, we have obtained a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. These insights will enable us to make data-driven decisions and develop strategies to mitigate churn rate effectively.

We encourage you to explore the project code and results for a more detailed understanding of our analysis.
